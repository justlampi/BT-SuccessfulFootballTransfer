Bachelor Thesis: Analysis and Prediction of Successful Football Player Transfers

This repository contains the code used for "Analysis and Prediction of Successful Football Player Transfers" to produce and verify the results. The code generates and cleans the data from Fbref.com and Transfermarkt.com, performs  principal component analysis (PCA), trains random forest models (both regression and classification) and visualizes the results.

To run the code you can follow the instructions below in the order provided. If you do not want to generate the data yourself, all data is provided to download and generate the models and plots.

## üîÅ Workflow Summary

To **run everything from scratch**, follow this order:

1. **PCA.Rmd**  
   - Performs PCA analysis on the raw data.
   - Generates transformed features for modeling.

2. **Daten.Rmd**  
   - Loads and processes the datasets.
   - Prepares the datasets for both regression and classification tasks.
   - Outputs cleaned datasets and generates transfer value

3. **rf.Rmd**  
   - Trains all random forest models (using `ranger`).
   - Saves the trained models (both regression and binary classification) in the `models/` folder using `.rds`.
   - Generates all variable interaction tables

4. **plots.Rmd**  
   - Generates 1D and 2D partial dependence plots.
   - Saves output plots into the `plots/` folder as PNG files using `ggsave()`.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### `csv data/`
Contains all cleaned datasets used or generated in the project.

- Example: `df_data2reg.csv`, `fw_data2bin.csv`, `train_data_df2.csv`, etc.

### `models/`
Contains all saved random forest models in `.rds` format.

- Example: `rfbin_df2.rds`, `rfreg_fw2.rds`, etc.

### `plots/`
Contains saved plots as image files (e.g., `.png`).

- Example: `vivi_df.png`, `vivi_fw.png`, etc.

### `data/`
Contains raw or intermediate data used in PCA or loaded in `Daten.Rmd`.

## üíæ To Load Everything Without Running Code

If you don't want to rerun the full pipeline, you can:

- Use the CSVs in `csv data/` to load all preprocessed datasets.
- Use the `.rds` files in `models/` to load trained models.
- Use the plots in `plots/` for visual analysis and reporting.

Example code to load a dataset and model:

```r
df_data2reg <- read.csv("csv data/df_data2reg.csv")
rfbin_df2 <- readRDS("models/rfbin_df2.rds")

This code 

For the code to work without loading any data previously, you first have to run PCA.Rmd, then you have to run Daten.Rmd to have all data. To run the models you have to run rf.Rmd. For the plots you need to run plots.Rmd. 
To load all data without running the code, you can use the csv files in the csv data folder and run them in the second chunk. The models are saved in the models folder. The plots are saved in the plots folder. The data is saved in the data folder.
